# Practicum
Collaborating this summer (2018) on the project is a graduate student from the University of Tennessee School of Information Sciences. 

## Description of the practicum
Collaborating on literary magazine redesign projects in progress or starting during 2018. The practicum will make use of some of the student's existing skills--research, writing, web design--while cultivating some new ones, such as website theme development and library publishing. 

## Student's description of how the practicum fits into his overall academic program and career goals
My goal is to graduate with marketable skills related to database design and management, and website design and management, along with library management. I have done work similar to this portion of this practicum project on a smaller scale. Certain aspects will be new to me, and will move me toward those goals. And I expect this practical experience to enable me to make the most of the IS technology courses I'll be taking in subsequent semesters.
